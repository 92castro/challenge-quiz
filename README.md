# Challenge-Quiz

## Task

MY task was to create a quiz of my choice with questions I want to ask. I made my quiz about a cartoon show with questions related to the show. When you start the quiz, you activate a timer and you have 45 seconds to complete the quiz. If you select the wrong answer, you lose 10 seconds from the timer. After completing the quiz, you are welcomed to add your initials and save your score. There's a local storage to save all your scores to compare previous attempts and you are given the option to clear your scores.

## User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
